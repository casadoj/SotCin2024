* *runoff_avg_1991-2020.nc*: the average runoff (kg/m2, or mm) in the GloFAS4 historical run from January 1 1991 to December 31 2020
* *runoff_avg_2024.nc*: the average runoff (kg/m2, or mm) in the GloFAS4 historical run for the year 2024.
* ***runoff_anomaly.nc***: the difference between the two files (mm/year). This is the final result to be added as a plot in the report.
