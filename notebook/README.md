# Notebooks

## Pre-processing

The notebook [**1_river_outlets.ipynb**]() selects river outlets from which the daily timeseries of discharge will be extracted.

## Post-processing

### Annual anomalies

The notebooks [**2.1_discharge_anomaly.ipynb**]() and [**2.2_runoff_anomaly.ipynb**]() create the maps of annual anomaly in the year 2024 for discharge and runoff, repectively.

### Interannual variability

The notebooks [**3.1_discharge_timeseries.ipynb**]() and [**3.2_runoff_timeseries.ipynb**]() create the time series required for the two figures in the report that analyse interannual and monthly variability of anomalies in terms of river discharge and runoff, respectively.
